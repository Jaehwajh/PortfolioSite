##Reflection

This is my second iteration of my Portfolio site. Compared to my first one this feels more like my own creation because I made with what I had designed in my head. My first site ever was made with a template which helped alot with the CSS design and Javascript, mobile support, etc. However, it didn't feel like what I made was my own. So I knew that at some point, I would make a version two of my portfolio site from the ground up.
